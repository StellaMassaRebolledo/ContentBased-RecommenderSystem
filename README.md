# Content-Based Recommender System

This content-based recommender system was built using information on different albums with their main features: artist, description, title, category, price and others. 
The three features chosen were: title, description and artist. The rest were irrelevant to this project or had incomplete data. 

## Cosine Similarity
For this recommender, cosine similarity was used to measure the similarity between two vectors, comparing each of the items with the rest.
